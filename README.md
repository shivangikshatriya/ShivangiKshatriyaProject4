An end-to-end Project using SQL, based on Pizza Hut Sales Dataset.

## Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL Project)
About the Project:
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to uncover business insights such as best-selling pizzas, revenue distribution, and customer preferences. The dataset contains information about orders, order details, and pizza types. By querying and analyzing the data, we aim to demonstrate how SQL can be used to perform real-world business analytics for decision-making in the food service industry.

## Dataset Description:
The project uses three main CSV files:
orders.csv → Contains order-level details such as order ID, date, and time.
order_details.csv → Contains line-item details for each order, including pizza type and quantity.
pizza_types.csv → Provides metadata about pizzas such as name, category, and ingredients.

## Objectives:
Import and clean raw sales data into a relational database.
Write SQL queries to analyze:
Top-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue
Sales distribution across categories (Classic, Veggie, etc.)
Revenue trends by day, week, and month
Impact of pizza size on sales
Generate insights to support data-driven decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin (for query execution & database management)
CSV Dataset (Pizza sales data)

## Insights Expected
Identification of best-selling pizzas and categories.
Understanding customer preferences based on pizza size and category.
Insights into sales performance over time.
Practical demonstration of SQL in real-world business analytics.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how SQL can be leveraged for data analysis and business intelligence. The insights derived can help pizza businesses optimize their menu, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.
